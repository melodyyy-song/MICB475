Couple Quick Questions
  Question: Do we have a shared space to work with data? Or do we need to denoise/cluster individually to look at the data
  Question: How do we add files on github that we can all view and edit (lab notebook)?
  Question: Can we work on the same file at the same time? Or only one person can make changes at once?

Research Question Ideas
  Q1? is there an association between smoking and obesity? (other studys show current smoker is less likely to be obese)
  Q2? Why city affects the different clusters of microbiota, more modernized, population statistics, etc.
  Q3? how do insulin levels correlate with gut microbiome
