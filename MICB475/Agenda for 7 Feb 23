Couple Quick Questions
  Question: Do we have a shared space to work with data? Or do we need to denoise/cluster individually to look at the data
  Question: How do we add files on github that we can all view and edit (lab notebook)?
  Question: Can we work on the same file at the same time? Or only one person can make changes at once?

Research Question Ideas
  Q1? is there an association between smoking and obesity? (other studys show current smoker is less likely to be obese)
  Q2? Why city affects the different clusters of microbiota, more modernized, population statistics, etc.
  Q3? how do insulin levels correlate with gut microbiome

Melody
- In figure 4, alll the PcoA data divides into 3 clusters, why does it do that?
--- maybe it reflects traditional, transitioning, and western diets?
-- Is there another trait that influences these clusters?
-Overall, I think characterizing the distinctions outlined in the paper (differences in abundances seen, reflecting phenotypes of people)
 and going more in depth about potential effects of each microbiota group will be good

-Characterize the microbiome for each/any of the categories (ex. age, sex, obesity) and determine potential effects on disease by looking at predicted functionality


Freda
-- The study has found that individuals with high abundance of Akkermansia-Bacteroidales and Ruminococcaceae CAGs are assocaited with low risk of obesity,
within these individuals, is there a correlation with age/sex/city group

-- compare with another dataset and see whether it display microbiota is traditional or western, or a spectrum with mixed microogranisms

-- is there an association between smoking and obesity? (other studies show current smoker is less likely to be obese)
-- does individuals who are on medications have a different microbiota?

Riley
- associations between two different factors
            - how do insulin levels correlate with gut microbiome
            - fiber intake change gut biome and stool consistency
            - do separate generations develop different mircobiota

Cathryn
-- the study showed that high abundance of Pathogen- and Lacchnospiraceae- CAGs are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and obesity,
why is it more likely to happen in Western microbiota and less of those CAGs abundance in non-Western microbiota? Is it true for all datasets out there?
-- Which factor induces a relatively more dominent role in the composition of gut microbiota? Diet, gender, medication, BMI, age, cities...?
