Can consider Git hub (instead of google docs)
Lab notebooks - activity, codes, etc. share with Avril (send agenda before next meetings)
Scripts as another document
Draft research questions
Maybe gut microbiome in columbia
Can also combine datasets (possibility: compare with the Tanzania dataset)
Additional analyses - tools beyond course content that could be explored
